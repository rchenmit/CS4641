supervised y = f(x); given f, find x;
	ex. 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4,x = 10, x^2 = 100
unsupervised f(x); given x, find f
reinforcement: come up with a set of actions you can actually take
	a = f(x) ; T, R, A (information about the world)
	you are NOT given a or f, you are given s, T, R, A and you have to find a, 
	and f, which MAP s, T, R, A (the world) into a set of functions
